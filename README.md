# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application using Angular JS 1.x

This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application.

### Server

Two Servers are provided, a Tomcat server, and a Apache server. Any servers which support JAVA EE would work instead for backend and any server would work for front end. You can use IIS/node/JBOSS server depending upon your experience. I have also attached the apache configuration file with this code base.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser. If you use remote server or different port then you may want to adjust the url in EventDataService.js file.
